To run the program, you can either:
1) Perform a "make", then execute the binary via "./Scene3D"
2) do a simple "./run.sh"

Homework took multiple nights: last sunday, monday, tuesday and wednesday , and vast majority of friday. Probably 20+ hours.

I had to look up how to use the vast majority of the functions
in my code from khronos.org

I couldn't find any great code to generate a flower, so I looked at some sources online, and couldn't find any good objects in C, only C++ so I took some of them and then created my own.

For generating the tubes, I used this one: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=2ahUKEwj-wrO2xeriAhVPAqwKHfjiA4YQFjAEegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opengl.org%2Farchives%2Fresources%2Fcode%2Fsamples%2Fredbook%2Ftorus.c&usg=AOvVaw3icr8b-leQmReARGah2xvx

I generated the algorithm for the diamond and the banner.
