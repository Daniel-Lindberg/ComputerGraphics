To run the program, you can either:
1) Perform a "make", then execute the binary via "./Homework3_Lindberg"
2) do a simple "./run.sh"

Homework took me most every single one of my evenings for the week, from previous sunday to following sunday. I work full time as an engineer.

I had to look up how to use the vast majority of the functions
in my code from khronos.org

Pages like this: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glTranslate.xml

really helped me understand what the functions were performing.
I also took some code from the professor's examples. 

The lighting functions I asked for some help from the TA to get a starting point.

I created my own textures.

The lighting and camera position can be changed:

  x_camera, y_camera, z_camera
  Value     |   Up   | Down
  --------------------------------
  x_camera  |   q    |    a
  y_camera  |   w    |    s
  z_camera  |   e    |    d

  light_pos[0,1,2]
  Value         |   Up   | Down
  --------------------------------
  light_pos[0]  |   u    |    j
  light_pos[1]  |   i    |    k
  light_pos[2]  |   o    |    l

  x_viewpoint, y_viewpoint
  Value         |   Up           | Down
  --------------------------------
  x_viewpoint  |   Left arrow    |    Right arrow
  y_viewpoint  |   Up arrow      |    Down Arrow
