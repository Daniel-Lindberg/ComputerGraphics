Here is my homework for the lorenz attractor.

To run the program, you can either:
1) Perform a "make", then execute the binary via "./Homework1_Lindberg"
2) do a simple "./run.sh"

Homework took me most of my evening on wednesday and thursday
and a couple of hours on sunday.

I had to look up how to use the vast majority of the functions
in my code from khronos.org

Pages like this: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glTranslate.xml

really helped me understand what the functions were performing.
I also took some code from the professor's examples. 

I believe I saw what compiler flags to take from the professor's make file, and I also looked at the imports 
and the basic functions on how to use a GUI

To move the GUI around, use the up, down left and right arrow keys

To move the values of s, b and r , use the following table:
	key|   Up   |	Down
	s  |   q    |    a
	b  |   w    |    s
	r  |   e    |    d
